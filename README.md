# Hand-tracking-3d-pathfinding
This repository contains a Python application that utilizes MediaPipe for real-time 3D hand tracking and implements the A* algorithm for pathfinding in a 3D space. The application captures hand movements via webcam and visualizes a path from the camera position to the tracked hand position using Pygame.
